Hey, I am KÃ©vin Renella, currently student in an engineering school of computer science. Passionated developer, my interest in computer science first started by learning the basics of algorithms and data structures, then, I enjoyed mastering many programming languages. My academic background also allowed me to fly over the embedded world of computer science.

Today my skills evolved and I continue to improve my knowledge by working on continuous integration, software package & integration, software architecture & analysis and on some (small) Open Source projects. After a few years of programmer experience, my favourite programming language stays C++/Qt!

Here you can find my articles, software and resume!
