## Personal statement

Today, computers can offer us infinity of possibilities, this ultimate technology allows us to create and innovate without any limitation. I have naturally chosen computer science as my studies and I have now developed skills in software analysis and development because of my various projects and internships.
My career objective is to bring my skills and creativity to a company.

## Employment and work experience

**Mobile Development Engineer**
<span class="right">October, 2014 - Today</span>
<br />Openium | France

My role at Openium is to develop applications on Android and iOS operating systems. I am mainly working on a push platform called Platinium using PHP and Symfony 2 framework. I also work on software quality and continuous integration to improve the deployment process of the company.

*Key-words : Android, iOS, Mobility, Continuous Integration, Symfony*

----------

**Solution Package Integrator**
<span class="right">September, 2013 to September, 2014</span>
<br />Michelin | France

In block release training at ISIMA and I was a **SPI team member** of the **Supply Chain** group platform at Michelin .

I was working on Hudson jobs automation and I developed and implemented a **generic process** to deploy applications in the supply chain.

Application deployment was managed by Jenkins, a **continuous integration** solution, which automates most of the process. However, the accumulation of applications and the difficulty to remove obsolete ones drives us to duplicate **Jenkins** tasks for each new version of an application and for each environment on which it is deployed. This duplication makes the jobs difficult to maintain and is a hard work for the set up of a new version of an application. We defined new generic processes and implemented new Jenkins tasks to reduce the complexity of deployments. Finally, we informed the involved teams of this new deployment solution and demonstrated its benefits.

*Key-words : Hudson, Jenkins, SPI, Supply Chain, Generic process, Continuous Integration*

----------

**Analyst developer for fire safety engineers**
<span class="right">June, 2013 to April, 2013</span>
<br />Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA) | France

There is many regulatory aspect related to fires in the Basic Nuclear Installations (BNI). It requests from the french nuclear operators (ANDRA, AREVA, CEA, EDF) to prove that their installations comply with the legislation, so the CEA developed a numerical simulation software to simulate fire in a nuclear experimental plant. 

My job was to design and develop an alternative to Excel to manipulate the results from the numerical simulation software of the **CEA**. The software was realized unsing **C++** and the **Qt** framework.

*Key-words : fire safety, C++, Qt, Curve Plotter*


----------

**Webmaster**
<span class="right">June, 2012 to April, 2013</span>
<br />Simply Pub | France

Developer for the Simply Pub company, my main job was to develop websites in **PHP** and **JavaScript** for various companies but I also had to develop a complete application for the management of a kayaking company.

*Key-words : C++, Qt, PHP, JavaScript, communication*

----------

**Analyst programmer**
<span class="right">January, 2012 to June, 2012</span>
<br />Blaise Pascal University | France

Development of various applications :

- Development of an autonomous process to analyze micro-hole’s junctions on multiple pictures or even videos in
order to be able to make statistics. Software made with **Qt (C++)** and **OpenCV**.
- Development of a serial port communication software for a multimeter device with the **Windows API**.
- Use of **Octave** to develop some computer vision algorithms (sub-imaging, Sobel, Canny) for **MATLAB**.
- Development of a complete and flexible placements manager made with **C++ / Qt**. Software thought by Mr.
Frédéric Chausse.

*Key-words : C++, Qt, autonomy, Octave*

----------

**iOS developer**
<span class="right">April, 2011 to August, 2011</span>
<br />Robert Gordon University | Scotland

Industrial placement during 12 weeks in a Scottish University (with report, viva voce).
Design and development of an **iPad** application, helping user to manage its bank accounts easily and anywhere he could be. Synchronization of the **iPad** on a website to make the account management flexible.
Use of **UML** to design the application and databases before development.

*Key-words : Objective-C, autonomy, iOS, XCode, PHP, UML*

## Project History

Here is a list of my main projects but you also can take a look at all my projects [on the article page](/articles/).

---------

**Files Drag & Drop**
<span class="right">Personal project</span>
<br />ISIMA | France

Files Drag & Drop is a software that will let you easily transfer files from a computer to another one, and from a computer to an Android device. This is an Open Source and intuitive transfer solution by drag & drop. The software include devices automatic detection over the Wi-Fi network.
<br />We distributed the Android application on the Play Store and have currently more than 3000 users.

*Key-words : transfer, drag & drop, Wi-Fi, user experience*

---------

**Tracking algorithm for an autonomous robot**
<span class="right">20 hours</span>
<br />ISIMA | France

Set up of an application with 3 people in order to pilot a robot using manual control (**Qt** graphical user interface) or autopilot by camera. The goal of the project was to make the entire robot based on a **Raspberry PI** and make it follow people.
Initialization of tracking algorithm as **Meanshift** with a color filtered image to track a red item.

Use of project management software and version control tools.

*Key-words : teamwork, robot, OpenCV, C++, Raspberry PI, Redmine*

----------

**Nano-holes analyzer**<span class="right">60 hours</span>
<br />  Institut Universitaire de Technologie en Informatique | France

Development of a nano-holes analyzer software, using Qt and OpenCV.
The goal of this project was to detect holes on a picture to automating the work of the physicists. The software can provide statistics to determine the nature of the materials used.
