When I started programming C++ software, I have always dreamt to develop a little game. After some practices of hangman and brick breakers in second year of Bachelor of Science in computer science (DUT Informatique), we had to develop a Plants vs Zombies like using C++ and SFML. Let's see the video.

Yep, I am not a graphist... But it remains fun!! :))
