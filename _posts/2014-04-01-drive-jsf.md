Drive.jsf is a Google Drive like developed in JSF using [PrimeFaces](http://primefaces.org/) components.

## Features

Our cloud solution includes :

- Google OAuth authentication to access the application
- Documents management page
    - Navigation tree (using double click)
    - Delete a file/folder
    - Download a file or a folder (as a zip)
    - Share a document
    - Upload a file / Create a new folder
    - Find your documents
- Sharing management page
    - See documents you shared
    - See documents shared to you
- Contextual menus

For that project, we used a smart database structure that store decoupled data. This method allows us unlimited duplication of files at low cost. A file has a logical connection to a given data. To know if a file data already exists, we use the MD5 checksum.

## GitHub

Drive.jsf is Open Source and [can be found on GitHub there](https://github.com/Aleanar/drive.jsf).
This is an engineering school project ([ISIMA](http://www.isima.fr)), we had time restrictions and so it is a quick & dirty implementation. This project aims to practice and get started with JSF & PrimeFaces.
