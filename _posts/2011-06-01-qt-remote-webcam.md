As I told, my favourite programming language remain the C++, using the Qt framework... So I began to develop some amazing desktop applications such as this remote webcam client. This software allow you to control multiple webcam remotely through Wi-Fi network or over the internet.

This application was developed in C++/Qt use OpenCV to retrieve webcam handlers and images. To test this application in real conditions, I tried to compile it on a Raspberry PI and it worked pretty well (with some lags), so I definitively can make many webcams for a little price and spy the places I want :)
