My first experience as a mobile developer began on iOS with the iPad when I travelled to Scotland for 3 month. I have chosen my own subject and worked on an account management application synchronised on the web. This application allow the user to register every single transaction to keep its accont management up to date.

The code should remain private, but I am sharing this demo.
