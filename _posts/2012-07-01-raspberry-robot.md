For our second year of engineering school project, we developed a tracking algorithm for an autonomous robot based on a Raspberry PI.
The goal was to set up an application with 3 people in order to pilot a robot using manual control (Qt graphical user interface) or autopilot by camera. We have chosen low costs components to build our robot, including the Raspberry PI itself, USB controller, a portable battery, a little webcam and some wheels.

Our tracking algorithm use **Meanshift** with a color filtered image as initialization to track a red item. Using Meanshift, we can easily follow people that have a red item on their legs. Lets see the video!
