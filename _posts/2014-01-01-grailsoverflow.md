- admin management

GrailsOverflow is Open Source and [can be found on GitHub there](https://github.com/k-yak/grailsoverflow).
This is an engineering school project ([ISIMA](http://www.isima.fr)), we had time restrictions and so it is a quick & dirty implementation. This project aims to practice and get started with Grails.

You can try the website at [http://grow.drusy.cloudbees.net/](http://grow.drusy.cloudbees.net/). Be patient, free cloudbees hosting could be slow at first launch :)
