## Goal

In this C++/Qt program, we try to show the consequencies of a possible zombies invasion. It's a agent-based simulation in which population protected by hunters try to survive against zombies.

This funny application of the C++ simualtion programming is a good way to work with severals patterns and smart agents oriented objects.

## How it looks ?
